Ideal Trimex
</h1>
<p>
In choosing a trimix, divers sometimes start with the "ideal trimix", which is defined as the trimix that has ah oxygen percentage that yields a PO2 of 1.4 and an END of 40 metres/130 feet at the planned depth. For a given set of deco gases it is the trimix with the theoretically shortest decompression for that depth based on using the highest possible oxygen content and the lowest possible helium content.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to find the ideal trimix is by using the Maximum Depth Table and the Equivalent Narcotic Depth Table. On the Maximum Depth Table, follow the 1.4 column to the desired depth, or next greater depth if the exact depth isnt listed. Then follow the row left to the oxygen percentage in the right column. this tells you the oxygen the blend can have and not exceed the maximum working PO2 of 1.4 ata.
</p>
<p>
On the Equivalent Narcotic Depth Table, follow the depth column for the planned depth to 40 metres/130 feet or the next shallower depth if 40 metres /130 feet isnt listed, then follow the row left to the helium percentage in the right column. This tells you the minimum helium you can have without an END deeper than 40 metres/130 feet. You round <i>down</i> in this case for the more conservative gas.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> What is the ideal trimix for 64 metres/210 feet?
</p>
<ul>
   <li>In the Maximum Depth Table, in the 1.4 column find 64 metres/210 feet. Go left to find 19 percent.</li>
   <li>Find the 66 metre (rounding up from 64)/210 foot depth column on the Equivalent Narcotic Depth Table, and follow it down to 40 metres/130 feet. Go left to find 34 percent (metric)/33 percent (imperial) helium (slight difference due to rounding in metric).</li>
   <li>The ideal trimix would therefore be TMx19/34 metric/TMx19/33imperial.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can do the same with formulas and a calculator, but the table method is easier.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Ideal Trimix is Often Not Ideal.</b>In fact, its <i>usually</i> not ideal. For one, it doesnt consider your oxygen exposure. Its better to deco longer than to push your oxygen exposure limits.
